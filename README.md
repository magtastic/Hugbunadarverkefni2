## Eventually
Eventually lets you view Facebook events based on location! By default it shows events based on your location but you can search for events at any location. 🌏
> Note: You can only search for events in Europe at the moment. The dates are represented differently in other locations and our Eventually expects the european format. 🇪🇺

To run on emulator in Android Studio, user has to enable Google Play Services.
`Tools > Android > SDK Manager > SDK Tools`

Events of current location should appear when user opens the app. If the events do not appear, user has to enable location services for the app and restart the app. The app only supports Android API version 25 or newer.
